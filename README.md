# DO NOT USE THIS PROJECT

It is bad. It is insecure. It is slow. It is single threaded. It is poorly coded. It is not worth your time

It was a learning experience. It answers the question "can I write an HTTP server?". The answer was "yes, but barely".

This is technically an http server. It doesn't support anything you would expect an http server to support, not even a proper 404 page.  But it serves files over http, so I consider the challenge complete.

But, if for some godforsaken reason, you want to do something with this code, it is GPLv3
