# DO NOT USE THIS PROJECT

It is bad. It is insecure. It is slow. It is poorly coded. It is not worth your time

It was a learning experience. It answers the question "can I write an HTTP server?". The answer was "yes, but barely".

This is technically an http server. It doesn't support anything you would expect an http server to support.  But it serves files over http, so I consider the challenge complete.

But, if for some godforsaken reason, you want to do something with this code, it is GPLv3
